# What is it?

This project is a full-stack MERN web application designed to help users learn or practice skills in basic education fields, such as mathematics and geography. The application features a user database that tracks progress of the user, so the user can see how much they study one area, how well they do, and other information..

# What technologies are involved?

This project has a number of technologies involved, including:

- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Node.JS
- Express.JS
- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken
- React
- Redux
- React Hooks
- Axios
- redux-thunk
- SASS

# What does it show?

This project demonstrates my (Joshua Patterson) ability to create a back-end NodeJS server, connect it to a front-end hosted in React, implement authentication from scratch via JWT and bcrypt, connect to and maintain a MongoDB database, display user data fetched from a database, create a number of custom hooks, and more.

All work involved in this project is my (Joshua Patterson) own code, written entirely from scratch.
